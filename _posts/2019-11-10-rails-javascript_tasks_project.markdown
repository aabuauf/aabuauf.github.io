It is my first backend-frontend project. Finally, I made the connection between the server using rails and the font end using JavaScript. This project is for Tasks, User can add Task with its due date and priority, each task has many activities.

User can Add Task, or delete it. That will reflect on server database. I Used fetch for both orders. Also User can Add/Delete or Update Activity status which will be modify in the database.

I made only 3 classes Task, Activity and one for constants that I am using. I tried to make the code clean as much as I can.
