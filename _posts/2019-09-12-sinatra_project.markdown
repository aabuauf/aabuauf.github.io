The idea of this project is one of my favorite ideas I want to apply. It is a tool to manage spare parts for any factory or refinery or any place that have assets and spare parts. I got this idea from my previous job as a maintenance manager in a refinery (before being a programmer). 

I made this idea as an android application and I used it with my engineers in the refinery. Now it is a good chance to have website doing the same.

This version has many options that wasnâ€™t in android version (Android version was for viewing only). In this website, it has full function for user signup, login and logout. Also, can edit, delete and add new spares.

It is part of my project that I want to do. I made it in android and now as a web page. I want to make a complete system for spare parts.
