I Cannot believe that I did it. I did website using rails. 4 weeks ago, I didnâ€™t know anything about rails. During that month,sometimes I felt that there is no way, I will not be to use rails. 

This Project to make spare parts management system for factories and refineries. It shows the details of the spare connecting to its assets(Equipment) in multi location factories.

It has full functions of signup, signin and signout. Also can use facebook as login method. It has many types of users. There is super-users (Admins) That can create equipment. 

In my previous version, it can create/modify or delete spares only. In this version it can create/ modify or delete equipment through super-users (Admins).

My dream becomes real. Now, I can make a website using the highest technology. I cannot believe that I am doing this.
