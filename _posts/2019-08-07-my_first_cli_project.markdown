I almost done with my first project. The project is scraping the rentalcars website. I got the idea when I was looking for a car to rent after making an accident the week-end before the project. 

The gem take 2 inputs, the pick-up date and drop-off date. It generates the URL for rentalcars.com and show the results. Also it shows more details about selected cars.

I am happy that I made that gem. I was asking myself all the time " when I will see my application?" 

Now , I can see it and will be published soon.
